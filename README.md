# Kerala IOT Challenge

> Foxlab Makerspace in association with GTech - Group of Technology Companies in Kerala is launching our prestigious program “Kerala IoT Challenge 2021”, with a vision to mould 100 IoT experts in Kerala, hosting on the µLearn platform. Kerala IoT Challenge is a program designed in 4 levels followed by a hackathon to identify and train quality industry leaders in the IoT domain, while any novice learner can start with layer 1 and others can enter laterally to the desired layer after an evaluation.
# About Me
> Hi everyone! I’m ArjunRaj, 4th year Electronics and Communication student from Eranad Knowledge City Technical Campus, Manjeri. I’m here to explore new dimensions in the majestuic world of Internet Of Things, aka IOT. I'm also intrested in similar fields such as Cyber Security, online marketing and creative design.

## Experiment 1 : Hello World LED Blinking

> A basic program similar to printing "*Hello World*" in any programming language. The aim is to blink an LED using **Arduino Uno Board**.

>**Arduino Uno** is an open-source microcontroller board developed by Arduino.cc. It has several advantages over the conventional microcontrollers. It comes with a pre-tested software and hardware libraries and has its own integrated development environment (IDE). Also it is less expensive & beginner friendly.

## Components Required  
* Arduino Uno Board 
* USB Cable 
* LED (Any Color) x 1 Nos
* 220 OHM Resistor X 1 Nos
* Breadboard 
* Jumper Wires (Male to Male ) X 2 Nos

## Code

```

int ledPin = 10; // define digital pin 10.
void setup()
{
pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);// define pin with LED connected as output.
}
void loop()
{
digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // set the LED on.
delay(1000); // wait for a second.
digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); // set the LED off.
delay(1000); // wait for a second
}

```

## Output

> The LED is blinked with a time interval of 1 second

# Experiment 2 : Traffic Light

> In the previous program, we have done the LED blinking experiment with one LED. Now, it’s time to up the stakes and do a bit more complicated experiment-traffic lights. Actually, these two experiments are similar. While in this traffic lights experiment, we use 3 LEDs with different colors rather than 1 LED.

## Components Required 

* Arduino board *1
* USB cable *1
* Red M5 LED*1
* Yellow M5 LED*1
* Green M5 LED*1
* 220Ω resistor *3

## Code

```

int redled =10; // initialize digital pin 10.
int yellowled =7; // initialize digital pin 7.
int greenled =4; // initialize digital pin 4.
void setup()
{
pinMode(redled, OUTPUT);// set the pin with red LED as “output”
pinMode(yellowled, OUTPUT); // set the pin with yellow LED as “output”
pinMode(greenled, OUTPUT); // set the pin with green LED as “output”
}
void loop()
{
digitalWrite(greenled, HIGH);//// turn on green LED
delay(5000);// wait 5 seconds
digitalWrite(greenled, LOW); // turn off green LED
for(int i=0;i<3;i++)// blinks for 3 times
{
delay(500);// wait 0.5 second
digitalWrite(yellowled, HIGH);// turn on yellow LED
delay(500);// wait 0.5 second
digitalWrite(yellowled, LOW);// turn off yellow LED
} 
delay(500);// wait 0.5 second
digitalWrite(redled, HIGH);// turn on red LED
delay(5000);// wait 5 seconds
digitalWrite(redled, LOW);// turn off red LED
}

```

## Output

> In Traffic light the green LED blink about 5 second, then it is turnoff. Then the yellow LED blinks 3 times with a time interval of 0.5 second.Then the red LED blink about 5 seconds. This process continues.

# Experiment 3 : LED Chasing Effect

> We often see billboards composed of colorful LEDs. They are constantly changing to form various light effects. In this experiment, we compile a program to simulate LED chasing effect. The long lead of LED is the positive side; short lead is negative.

## Components Required

* Led *6
* Arduino board *1
* 220Ω resistor *6
* Breadboard *1
* USB cable*1
* Breadboard wire *13

int BASE = 2 ;  // the I/O pin for the first LED
int NUM = 6;   // number of LEDs
void setup()
{
   for (int i = BASE; i < BASE + NUM; i ++) 
   {
     pinMode(i, OUTPUT);   // set I/O pins as output
   }
}
void loop()
{
   for (int i = BASE; i < BASE + NUM; i ++) 
   {
     digitalWrite(i, LOW);    // set I/O pins as “low”, turn off LEDs one by one.
     delay(200);        // delay
   }
   for (int i = BASE; i < BASE + NUM; i ++) 
   {
     digitalWrite(i, HIGH);    // set I/O pins as “high”, turn on LEDs one by one
     delay(400);        // delay

## Code

```

int ledpin=11;// initialize pin 11
int inpin=7;// initialize pin 7
int val;// define val
void setup()
{
pinMode(ledpin,OUTPUT);// set LED pin as “output”
pinMode(inpin,INPUT);// set button pin as “input”
}
void loop()
{
val=digitalRead(inpin);// read the level value of pin 7 and assign if to val
if(val==LOW)// check if the button is pressed, if yes, turn on the LED
{ digitalWrite(ledpin,LOW);}
else
{ digitalWrite(ledpin,HIGH);}
}

```
## Output

> When the push button is pressed the LED is turned on otherwise it is off.
